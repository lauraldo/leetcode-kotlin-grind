**Disclaimer**

This is my leetcode grind repo.
I'm trying to solve problems using Kotlin.

It's a *playground*, not a *tutorial*.

It may include naive and brute-force solutions, which may not be the best on LeetCode.

Even if the algorithm has good speed in terms of Big-O, I usually don't use platform hacks to boost its speed to gain best runtime.

You have been warned.
